Originally from Maine, I lived in Florida, Chicago and Philadelphia before settling down in Denver. I worked as a Nanny for 10+ years, with jobs ranging from a family with 4 school aged boys, to a special needs baby with a rare genetic disorder, to a live-in nanny for a Professional Athlete. After that, I spent 3 years working in Commercial Real Estate, doing retail leasing for class A retail space in urban areas. 

I had been intrigued by technology since childhood, when I did (coding on mac). I never forgot how fascinating it was to build and test something. In 2016 I decided to make the jump in to Tech.

I currently work as a User Experience Designer at Dish Network on the Sling TV product, focusing on customer acquisition for sling.com.
