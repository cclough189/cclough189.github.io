Originally from Maine, I lived in Florida, Chicago and Philadelphia before settling down in Denver. I worked as a Nanny for 10+ years, with jobs ranging from a family with 4 school aged boys, to a special needs baby with a rare genetic disorder, to a live-in nanny for a Professional Athlete. After that, I spent 3 years working in Commercial Real Estate, before making the jump to Tech in 2016.

I currently work as a User Experience Designer at Dish Network on the Sling TV website. I focus on the customer acquisition/ecommerce side of the site.
